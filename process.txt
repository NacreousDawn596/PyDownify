- The code opens a Spotify playlist and then uses the read() method to get all of the information.
- The result is parsed into json, which is then loaded into a variable called result.

- The code starts by importing sys, os, time, YouTube from pytube import YouTube , and youtubesearchpython from youtubesearchpython import VideosSearch .
- Then it opens up an input file with the name of the playlist as its first argument.
- It also imports json so that it can parse out some data about Spotify's entity ID for this particular playlist.- The code is used to parse the Spotify URI, which can be found in the playlist argument.

- The code then uses that parsed Spotify URI to search for a list of videos on YouTube.- The code starts by opening a file called PyDownify.py in the current directory.
- The code then creates an object called result and stores it in the variable result.
- It then checks to see if os.popen('uname -o').read() == "Android".
- If so, it sets playlist_name to "/sdcard/PyDownify/{result['name']}" else it sets playlist_name to result['name'].
- Then, using os.system(), the code makes a folder named "PyDownify" on your SD card and runs mkdir("PyDownify").

- The next function is getUrl().
- This function takes one argument: name which will be used as the search term for videos that match this name (e.g., "Minecraft").
- VideosSearch is created with this search term and limit set at 1 meaning only one video will be returned from this call (the first).
- The print statement prints out the title of each video found followed by a period ("...").
- Finally, return returns two values: url which is a string containing all of the links for these videos and name which contains just their titles (e.g., "Minecraft-0").

- The download function takes one argument: name- The code will download the first video from a search result and save it to the specified playlist.

- The below code is used to download all videos from a given search result:

- def getUrl(name): 	videosSearch = VideosSearch(name, limit = 1) 	print(videosSearch.result()['result'][0]['title'], "...") 	return {'url': videosSearch.result()['result'][0]['link'], 'name': videosSearch.result()['result'][0]['title']}- The code starts by getting the URL of allstuff.
- Then it gets the title from that URL and uses replace to change any spaces in the name into underscores, removes any punctuation, and replaces "it's" with "its".
- It then checks if there is a file called f"{title}.mp3" in os.popen(f'ls "{playlist_name}"').read().
- If so, it downloads that file using YouTube() and returns it.
- Otherwise, it goes through all of its videos on YouTube() and filters them for progressive content (so they are not just still images) using filter(), finds the first one with an mp4 extension (which means video), downloads that video using download(), tries to analyze it with Analyze(), but fails because there was no mp3 file associated with this video.- The code will download all of the videos in a playlist and save them to your local machine.

- The code above attempts to be used with YouTube's API, which can be found at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/.- The code is a function that takes in a title and returns an mp4_file, mp3_file, or audioclip.
- The verification() function is used to verify the file exists before playing it.

- The code starts by importing the os module which is used for system commands.
- Then it creates two variables: title and playlist_name.
- The variable title will be passed into the verification() function as input while playlist_name will be passed into the playlists() function as input.

- The first line of code opens up a command prompt with "ls {playlist_name}" so that we can see if there are any files in our playlist called "title".
- If there are no files in our playlist called "title", then we use ffmpeg to create one from an existing video file using -i option followed by its filename (in this case, myvideo).
- We also specify -q:a 0 which means that audio should not be played on this clip but subtitles should still show up on screen when they're available (0).
- Next, we map A-D to E-G respectively using -map option followed by what letter corresponds with what number (A = 1, B = 2 etc.).
- Lastly, we write- The code is a function that verifies if the title of the video file is in the playlist.
- If it is not, then ffmpeg will be run to convert the mp4 file into an mp3 file and place it in the playlist.

- The code above also has an exception for when there are no videos found within the playlist.
- In this case, ffmpeg will be run to convert a mp4 file into an mp3 file and place it in the playlist.- The code starts by opening a file called "ls *.mp4".
- This will list all the files in the current directory that end with ".mp4" and then open them.
- The code then splits these lines into individual files, one per line.

- The next part of the code is where it gets interesting:

- for unconverted_title in os.popen('ls *.mp4').splitlines():

- if f"{unconverted_title}.mp3" not in os.popen(f"ls {playlist_name}").read(): 	os.system(f'ffmpeg -i "{title}" -q:a 0 -map a "{playlist_name}/{unconverted_title}.mp3"' )

- This part of the code looks for any file that ends with .mp4 but doesn't have an extension of mp3, which means it's not an MP3 file (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3).
- If there are no such files, this section of the script will run ffmpeg to convert any such title to mp3 format and save it as playlist name/unconverted title .
- mp3 on disk so they can be played later on- The code attempts to delete the mp4 file that was converted from a video and then rename it to the original name.

- The code will first open up a list of all mp4 files in the current directory and split them into lines.

- Next, if there is an mp3 file with the same name as one of these videos, it will run ffmpeg on that file using -i flag and convert it to an mp3.

- If there isn't an mp3 file with the same name as one of these videos, then it will delete that video and rename it back to its original filename.- The code starts by searching for videos that have the track name "The Beatles" and limit to 1.
- The result is a list of videos with their titles.
- Then it downloads the first video from each list, renames them as .mp4, then deletes all files in the playlist named "The Beatles".- The code will download the first video from the playlist "VideosSearch(track['track']['name'], limit = 1).result()['result'][0]['title']" and save it to a file named "{playlist_name}/{title}.mp4".

- If there is an error during the process, then the code will delete all files with a .mp4 extension in the same directory as "{playlist_name}/{title}.mp3".
